Welcome to our little corner of the Internet!

## What We Do:

Desnudo Penguino Designs provides appropriate solutions for your needs by utilizing a host of current technologies and processes.
We follow a simple five-step plan:
1. __Observe__ - We collect data on your system(s) and how your users interact with it.
2. __Analyze__ - We analyze the data we collected and establish a goal with you.
3. __Plan__ - We develop a plan to reach your goal.
4. __Execute__ - We flexibly follow the plan and achieve your goal.
5. __Repeat__ - We incrementally repeat this process until all your goals have been met.

## Who We Are:

We are a group (*well there's currently only one of us*) of passionate and highly skilled technological problem solvers that love being challenged on a daily basis.
